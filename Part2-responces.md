# Solutions Engineer: Part 2

### Question 1

> Hello,
> 
> I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:
> 
>* Records
>* Indexing
>
> I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."
> 
> Cheers,

Hi George,

Thanks for reaching out! Here are the definitions to the concepts you requested:

* A **record** is any object you add in your Index and want to search for. They hold all of the attributes for each object and are used to provide your users with your search results.

* **Indexing** is a data structure technique our search engine uses to quickly locate and access information the records.


Helpful metrics when using **custom ranking** can include:

* Number of sales, views, or likes
* Ratings
* Date of release

This kind of control over ranking allows you to achieve many business goals: to showcase your product-line, to encourage people to stay on your site and view as many products as possible, to increase sales, among others.

Looking forward to seeing the creative ways you use Algolia!

Best,

Sean

### Question 2

> Hello,
> 
> Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

> Regards,

Hi Matt,

Thank you for your candid feedback. I am sorry to hear that the new dashboard design is disrupting your workflow. As you know, our goal is to empower users to find what they are looking for. We will use the feedback to improve the dashboard's design and ensure developers have convenient access to the tools they use most!

Best,

Sean

### Question 3
> Hi,
> 
> I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high level process look like?

> Leo

Hi Leo,

Happy to see you would like to integrate Algolia into your website! You can integrate Algolia [InstantSearch](https://community.algolia.com/#instantsearch) with as little as **25 lines** of code!

To get started, all you need to do is:

1. Create an [Algolia account](https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up) and index your data.
2. Configure the basic relevance settings for the data through our Dashboard or API access.
3. Use InstantSearch's pre-built [user interface widgets](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/widgets/showcase/js/) to interact with your results.

You can find more details on our [Getting Started](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/getting-started/js/#build-a-simple-ui) guide. As always, please let me know if you have any other questions. I am more than happy to help!

Best,

Sean
